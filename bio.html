            Passive-aggressive capitalist whore, born and raised in the 9th biggest country in the world, where people
            drink horse milk and women prefer big dick porno. At the age of 3 got lost on floating ice while searching
            for grandfathers&prime; sheep. Accidentally broke the nose of a classmate who was in love with her. On freshmen
            day in Russian university got drunk and fell into a river with a bench. Studied environmental engineering in
            Finland, learned Gram staining, and grew germs in a lab. Crossed Europe with a 125cc motorcycle in 23 days.
            Walked the Camino Portugues, Muxia, and Finistere. Exhibited her photography in a tiny city somewhere in
            Finnish woods and many other unpopular places.
